# CTF Problems
This repository contains a mix of CTF problems and scripts that I have written to auto-generate CTF problems. These are generally basic problems that explore conecpts such as digital forensics and web application vulnerabilities. Below I have listed breif descriptions of each problem contained in this repository.

| Problem | Category | Description |
|  :---:  |  :----:  | :---        |
| Big JPEG | Forensics / Steganography | Uses a combination of common steganographic processes to embed the flag within an image |
| PNG LSB Red Green | Forensics / Steganography | Uses least significant bit with XOR to embed the flag into the pixel data of a PNG image |
| SQL Injection | Web / SQL Injection | A basic LAMP stack web application with SQL injection vulnerabilites accessible through some of the text input fields |
